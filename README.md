# 3D-WheatSpikeMorphologyExtraction
High-resolution 3D pipeline for quantifying wheat spike morphology. Includes tools for 3D spike mesh analysis, trait extraction, thickness profiling and statistical modeling to capture spike main segments (zone of aborted spikelets, base and apex),  length, volume, curvature, and branching for advanced phenotyping.
